Babel is a compiler created by Sebastian McKenzie in 2014 to convert ES6 to ES5 (originally called 6to5). It has since become a toolchain that enables developers to write any next generation JavaScript as well as serve as a testing ground for proposals from TC39, the technical committee that specifies ECMAScript.
